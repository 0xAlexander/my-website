## Getting Started 🚀

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that was initially bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

1. First, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Make sure it builds:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Run it locally

```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying the appropriate components/sections. The page auto-updates as you edit and save.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
